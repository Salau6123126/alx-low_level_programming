# Hello World!

## Some notable mentions:

* C, computer programming language was developed in the early 1970s by the American Computer Scientist Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories. 
* Brian Kernighan, a Canadian computer scientist who also worked at Bell Labs and contributed to the development of Unix alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. He is widely known for his co-authorship of the first book on the C programming Language with Dennis Ritchie.
* Linus Benedict Torvalds, a Finnish-American Software Engineer who created the Linux kernel used by Linux distributions and other operating systems like Android.

## Some useful info:
* Typing `gcc main.c` creates an out file, which is a compiled and executable file. with the out file, you can then run the program.
* An entry point is a point in a program where the execution of a program begins, and where the program has access to command line arguments.
* The `main` function serves as the starting point for program execution.
* The default executable output of gcc is `a.out`

### [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) runs a C file `main` through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file `c`
### [1-compiler](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) compiles a C file `main.c`, but does not link.
### [2-assembler](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) generates assembly code of aC code and saves it in an output file.
### [3-name](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name) compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

### [5-printf.c](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line.
### [6-size.c](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
### [100-intel](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) generates the assembly code (intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
### [101-quote.c](https://github.com/Salau6123126/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
